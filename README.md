## API Performance Test with Jmeter
## Prerequisite
- API Test site
- Jmeter
- Windows command tool
## About This project
This project is reflecting performance of this project server.How the server is behaving while facing high level of user hit at a time.
we will find this server throughput,when the server started to show low performance and till how many user can handle easily at a time.
## Summery of report
- Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test Server. 
- Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server ```Server```(https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/) 
- 200 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 234 And Total 
Concurrent API requested: 1400.
- 300 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 350 And Total 
Concurrent API requested: 2100.
- 400 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 424 And Total 
Concurrent API requested: 2800.
- 500 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 443 And Total 
Concurrent API requested: 3500.
- While executed 500 concurrent request, found 82 request got connection timeout and error rate 
is 0.23%. 
- Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 3200 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
