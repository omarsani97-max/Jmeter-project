## API Performance Test with Jmeter
## Prerequisite
- API Test site
- Jmeter
- Windows command tool
## About This project
This project is reflecting performance of this project server.How the server is behaving while facing high level of user hit at a time.
we will find this server throughput,when the server started to show low performance and till how many user can handle easily at a time.
## Summery of report
- Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test Server. 
- Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in ```Server```(https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/) 
- 5000 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 49.98 And Total Concurrent API requested: 5000.
- 8000 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 76.89 And Total Concurrent API requested: 8000.
- 10000 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 99.84 And Total Concurrent API requested: 10000.
- Gradually increase user request till 28000 then found error.
- 28000 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 108.54 And Total Concurrent API requested: 28000.
- While executed 28000 concurrent request, found 4 request got " Non HTTP response code: java.net.SocketException" and error rate is 0.01%.
- Then 29000 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 138.87 And Total Concurrent API requested: 29000.
- While executed 29000 concurrent request, found 4676 request got " Non HTTP response code: java.net.SocketException" and error rate is 16.12%
- Then error rate increased with concurrent request number.

- Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 28000 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
